	<h1>Notes for Javascript</h1>

	<h2> Where to </h2>
	<p>
		In html, Javascript must be inserted between &lt;script&gt; and &lt;/script&gt; tags.		
	<br>
		A Javascript <b>function</b> is a block of JavaScript code, that can be executed when "asked" for.
	<br>
		Scripts can be placed in the &lt;body&gt; or &lt;head&gt; section of an HTML page, or in both. Note: keeping all code in one place is a good habit.
	<br>
		It is a good idea to place scripts at the bottom of the &lt;body&gt; element. This can improve page load, because HTML display is not blocked by scripts loading.
	<br>
		Scripts can also be placed in external files. External scripts are practical when the same code is used in many differnt web pages. Javascript files have the file extension <b>.js</b>.
		To use an external scruot, put the name of the script file in the <b>src</b> attribute of the &lt;script&gt; tag. External scripts cannot contain &lt;script&gt; tags.
	<br>
		Placing JavaScripts in external files has some advantages:
			<ul>
				<li>It seperates HTML and code.</li>
				<li>It makes HTML and JavaScript easier to read and maintain.</li>
				<li>Cached JavaScript files can speed up page loads.</li>
			</ul>
	</p>

	<h2> Output </h2>
	<p>
		JavaScript can "display" data in different ways:
			<ul>
				<li>writng into an alert box, using <b>window.alert()</b>.</li>
				<li>writing into the HTML output using <b>document.write()</b>. Note: using this after an HTML document is fully loaded will delee all existing HTML. This should be only used for testing.</li>
				<li>writing into an HTML element using <b>innerHTML</b>. Note: this is a commonly used method.</li>
				<li>
					writing into the browser console, using <b>console.log</b>.
					Note: to access an HTML element, JavaScript can use the <b>document.getElementById(id)</b> method. The <i><b>id</b></i> attribute idenifies the HTML element. The <b>innerHTML</b> property is the element content.
				</li>
			</ul>
		<br>
		Note: Activate debugging in our browser (Chrome, IE, Firefox) with F12, and select Console in the debugger menu to see the console log.
