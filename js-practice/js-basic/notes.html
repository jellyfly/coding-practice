	<h1>Notes for Javascript</h1>

	<h2> Where to </h2>
	<p>
		In html, Javascript must be inserted between &lt;script&gt; and &lt;/script&gt; tags.		
	<br>
		A Javascript <b>function</b> is a block of JavaScript code, that can be executed when "asked" for.
	<br>
		Scripts can be placed in the &lt;body&gt; or &lt;head&gt; section of an HTML page, or in both. Note: keeping all code in one place is a good habit.
	<br>
		It is a good idea to place scripts at the bottom of the &lt;body&gt; element. This can improve page load, because HTML display is not blocked by scripts loading.
	<br>
		Scripts can also be placed in external files. External scripts are practical when the same code is used in many differnt web pages. Javascript files have the file extension <b>.js</b>.
		To use an external scruot, put the name of the script file in the <b>src</b> attribute of the &lt;script&gt; tag. External scripts cannot contain &lt;script&gt; tags.
	<br>
		Placing JavaScripts in external files has some advantages:
			<ul>
				<li>It seperates HTML and code.</li>
				<li>It makes HTML and JavaScript easier to read and maintain.</li>
				<li>Cached JavaScript files can speed up page loads.</li>
			</ul>
	</p>

	<h2> Output </h2>
	<p>
		JavaScript can "display" data in different ways:
			<ul>
				<li>writng into an alert box, using <b>window.alert()</b>.</li>
				<li>writing into the HTML output using <b>document.write()</b>. Note: using this after an HTML document is fully loaded will delee all existing HTML. This should be only used for testing.</li>
				<li>writing into an HTML element using <b>innerHTML</b>. Note: this is a commonly used method.</li>
				<li>
					writing into the browser console, using <b>console.log</b>.
					Note: to access an HTML element, JavaScript can use the <b>document.getElementById(id)</b> method. The <i><b>id</b></i> attribute idenifies the HTML element. The <b>innerHTML</b> property is the element content.
				</li>
			</ul>
		Note: Activate debugging in our browser (Chrome, IE, Firefox) with F12, and select Console in the debugger menu to see the console log.
	</p>

	<h2> Syntax </h2>
	<p>
		A computer program is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by a computer.
		Javascript is the most popular programming language in the world.
		In a programming language, computer instructions are called statements.
		JavaScript <b>syntax</b> is the rules, how Javascript programs are constructed.
		<br>
		The purpose of a statement, is to tell the computer what to do.
		In HTML, JavaScript statements are executed by the web browser.
		JavaScript statements are separated by <b>semicolon</b>.
		<br>
		JavaScript statements are composed of:
		<ul>
			<li>Values, Operators, Expressions, Keywords, and Comments.</li>
		</ul>
		The JavaScript syntax defines two types of values: Fixed values and variable values.
		<ul>
			<li>Fixed values are called <b>literals</b>.</li>
			<li>Variable values are called <b>variables</b>.</li>
		</ul>
		The most important rules for writing fixed values are:
		<ul>
			<li><b>Numbers</b> are written with or without decimals.</li>
			<li><b>Strings</b> are text, written within double or single quotes.</li>
			<li><b>Expressions</b> can also represent fixed values.</li>
		</ul>
		JavaScript Operators:
		<ul>
			<li><b>assignment operator</b> (=) to <b>assign</b> values to variables.</li>
			<li><b>arithmetic operators</b> (+ - */) to <b>compute</b> values.</li>
		</ul>
		JavaScript <b>keywords</b> are used to identify actions to be performed. The <b>var</b> keyword tells the browser to create a new variable.
		<br>
		Not all Javascript statements are "executed".
		Code after double slashes // or between /* and */ is treated as a <b>comment</b>.
		Comments are ignored, and will not be executed.
		<br>
		All JavaScript identifiers are <b>case sensitive</b>. The variables <b>lastName</b> and <b>lastname</b> are two different variables.
		<br>
		JavaScript does not interpret <b>VAR</b> or <b>Var</b> as the keyword <b>var</b>.
		<br>
		JavaScript uses the <b>Unicode</b> character set.
		Unicode covers (almost) all the characters, punctuations, and symbols in the world.

	</p>
	<h2> Statements</h2>
	<p>
		In HTML, Javascripts statements are "instructions" to be "executed" by the web browser.
		<br>
		Most JavaScript programs contain many JavaScript statements. The statements are executed, one by one, in the same order as they are written.
		<br>
		JavaScript programs (and JavaScript statements) are often called JavaScript code.
		<br>
		Semicolons separate JavaScript statements. Normally you add a semicolon at the end of each executable statement.
		When separated by semicolons, multiple statements on one line are allowed.
		<b>Ending statements with semicolon is optional in JavaScript.</b>
		<br>
		JavaScript ignores extra spaces. You can add white space to your script to make it more readable.
		<br>
		JavaScript statements can be grouped together in blocks.
		Blocks start with a left curly bracket, and end with a right curly bracket.
		The purpose of a block is to make the sequence of statements execute together.
		A good example of statements grouped together in blocks, are in JavaScript <b>functions</b>.
		JavaScript statements often start with a <b>keyword</b> to identify the JavaScript action to be performed.
		JavaScript keywords are reserved words that cannot be used as variable names (or any other things).
		Here is a list of some of the keywords:
		<ul>
			<li>break: terminates a switch or a loop</li>
			<li>catch: marks the block of statements to be executed when an error occurs in a try block</li>
			<li>continue: jumps out of a loop and starts at the top</li>
			<li>debugger: stops the execution of JavaScript, and calls(if available) the debugging function</li>
			<li>do ... wh</li>
		</ul>
